# Introduction

This project is An API and administrative tool for collecting quick user feedback across TNA sites, in the style of the [GOV.UK feedback component](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/28/making-the-gov-uk-feedback-component-more-accessible/).

See [Key Concepts](./key-concepts.md) for further information.

This project uses the Django admin interface to manage feedback prompt questions and multiple choice answers, and decide which prompts are offered to users on which URLs. This is intended to be a temporary interface which will be replaced with a custom UI.

See [Technical Guide](./technical-guide.md) for more technical information.
